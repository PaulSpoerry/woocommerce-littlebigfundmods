Remove product images from WooCommerce Product. 
Set WooCommerce Virtual Order Status to Complete After Payment

== Description ==

By default WooCommerce shows a giant image (if left empty) or a product image or gallery if supplied. We don't want that so we're going to remove it.
WooCommerce virtual orders can be automatically marked as ‘completed’ after payment with a little bit of code added to a custom plugin, or your themes functions.php file. By default WooCommerce will mark virtual-downloadable orders as ‘completed’ after successful payment, which makes sense, but some store owners will want to be able to automatically mark even a virtual order as complete upon payment, for instance in the case of a site which takes donations where no further action is required.
